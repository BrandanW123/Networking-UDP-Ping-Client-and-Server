# Networking-UDP-Ping-Client-and-Server
This repository displays a client and server program that uses UDP sockets to determine the round-trip time (RTT) to the server. To calculate the RTT delay, the client records the time it takes to send a ping request to the server and then the time it takes to get a ping response from the server. The RTT is the difference between the two times.
